# Web workspace plan (`web/`)

This file is part of the [DECA Mark production plan](../docs/plan/README.md) and defines the `WEB-*` tasks. Related plan files:
- **API shapes:** [contracts.md](../docs/plan/contracts.md).
- **The API side:** [backend/PLAN.md](../backend/PLAN.md).
- **User journeys:** J1, J3 and J4 in [product.md](../docs/plan/product.md#journeys-the-pilot-must-support).
- **Fixture list:** [architecture.md](../docs/plan/architecture.md#fixture-inventory) records the fixtures that D30 removed from the web.
- **Local rules:** `web/AGENTS.md` still applies. In particular:
  - every workspace page is live (D30): no fixtures, no Preview data marker, and a feature with no backend says "X is not available yet." (the Honesty section of `web/AGENTS.md`);
  - Contour tokens change only in `contracts/contour.json`; `pnpm tokens` regenerates `src/styles/contour.css`, and the collector reads the same file (D19).

**Skills to load** when working here: `vercel-plugin:nextjs`, `frontend-dashboard-polish`, `responsive-design`, `site-architecture`.

## Original baseline (verified 2026-09-22)

Current changes verified 2026-10-04: WEB-01 package uploads use a real selected project and an authenticated session. WEB-03 through WEB-05 add Supabase SSR authentication, protected account/onboarding routes and a server-only API client. `/account` reads live `/v1/me` data; workspace and onboarding content remains a fixture preview. The service worker now allows only public landing/static assets and excludes private, query-bearing and RSC requests. The baseline below records the starting point, not current behavior.

- **Stack and auth.** Next.js 16.2.7, React 19.2.4, Tailwind v4, react-leaflet 5. There is no Supabase package, no `proxy.ts`, no route handlers, no auth, and no error or not-found pages.
- **Data.**
  - Every workspace screen imports fixtures from `src/data/*`. `VIEWER` is hard-coded to Janet (`src/data/project.ts:70-76`).
  - The only network call is the package upload (`src/lib/packages.ts:82`). It posts to `PROJECT.id = "prj-riverside-play-study"` (`src/data/project.ts:19`), which is not a UUID, so the API returns 422. The manager's token is pasted in (`PackageUpload.tsx:166-181`).
- **Routes.**
  - `(marketing)` at `/`.
  - `(workspace)`: `/overview`, `/observations`, `/places`, `/basemaps`, `/instrument`, `/qgis`, with no project in the URL.
  - `(legal)`: `/privacy`, `/privacy/delete-data`. The privacy copy says administrators create accounts, which is wrong now that sign-up is public.
- **Offline caching.** WEB-02 now generates `public/sw.js` from a source template with a token for each build. It caches only the public landing shell, icons and static build assets, validates responses, and keeps the shell network-first. The manifest opens `/o`.
- **Tablet and touch.** The three-pane Observations view needs a width of at least 1280 px. Several tap targets are 32–40 px (`RailNav.tsx:31`, `chrome.tsx:171,423`, `PackageUpload.tsx:145`).

## Target route tree

This is the tree in `web/src/app` today (WEB-27). The route group `(auth)/(signed-in)` is now `(auth)/(join)`, because `/invite` and `/join` also serve signed-out visitors.

```
src/app/
  (marketing)/page.tsx                       /
  (legal)/…                                  /privacy, /privacy/delete-data
  (auth)/(signed-out)/…                      /sign-in, /sign-up, /verify, /forgot-password, /reset-password
  (auth)/(join)/…                            /invite (token in the URL fragment), /join (type a code)
  (app)/account/page.tsx                     profile, password, sign out, delete account
  (app)/o/page.tsx                           opens the remembered project, the only project, or the first organization
  (app)/o/[org]/…                            header, no tabs: collect (observer handoff), [...missing], not-found, error
  (app)/o/[org]/(org)/…                      projects (org root), members, settings
  (app)/o/[org]/p/[project]/…                overview (project root), data, data/[observation],
                                             sites, sites/[site], sites/[site]/packages (?package=, ?step=upload),
                                             forms, forms/versions, forms/versions/[version],
                                             forms/versions/[version]/publish, team, qgis, reports, settings
  dev/contour/                               every primitive in Day and Dusk (dev and preview builds only)
src/proxy.ts                                 session refresh + auth redirects
src/lib/supabase/{server,client}.ts
src/lib/api/{client,workspace,mutations}.ts  server-only: cached reads, one function per write
src/lib/api/browser.ts                       browser to API: package upload and archive download only
src/lib/workspace/…                          roles, the /o resolver, results (pure, unit-tested)
src/components/contour/…                     primitives, same names as mobile/src/ui/
src/components/shell/…                       header, switchers, tabs, ⌘K, LoadFailure, NotAvailable
src/features/<area>/…
```

Removed in WEB-27: `(onboarding)`, `(org)/library`, `sites/[site]/zones/**`, `reports/views`, `reports/[report]` and `settings/rounds`. `/o/deca` is an ordinary address now, not a sample.

A project has eight tabs: Overview, Data, Sites, Forms, Team, QGIS, Reports, Settings. An organization has three: Projects, Members, Settings. The header holds the organization and project switchers, "Search or jump to" (⌘K) and the account menu (with Day · Dusk). Team and Settings are for project managers. Members and the organization's Settings are for owners and admins, who also act as managers of every project in the organization. Nobody else sees those tabs, and those pages check the role themselves and show a no-access note. An observer who opens a project is sent to `/o/<org>/collect`. `/o` opens the project the person was last in (cookie `fm-place`), the only project, or the first organization. The old paths (`/overview`, `/observations`, `/places`, `/basemaps`, `/instrument`, `/qgis`, `/onboarding`) redirect with a 307 to `/o`. `library`, `sites/<site>/zones/**`, `reports/views` and `settings/rounds` redirect to the page that replaced them. Every route under `(auth)` and `(app)`, and `/dev/contour`, is `noindex`.

**Contour screens, then live data.** WEB-20 to WEB-26 built every page above in Contour on fixtures (D19–D22), and the wiring tasks WEB-04 to WEB-13 were to connect real data to them. WEB-27 (D30) wired all of it at once and removed the fixtures. There is one workspace now: every page under `/o/<org>/p/<project>` reads and writes the API for the signed-in person. The sample workspace at `/o/deca`, the Preview data marker, the set-up flow and the preview sign-in bypass (D20, D23, D24) are gone. A feature with no backend shows one "X is not available yet." note. Where a task below names something WEB-27 retired (`src/data/*`, `src/fixtures/*`, `LeafletCanvas`, `ZonePlan`, `(onboarding)`), read the WEB-27 note at the top of that task. The design pages named under `Read first` come from the four Contour design sets, which are not committed ([docs/ux/README.md](../docs/ux/README.md)); root `DESIGN.md` is the committed reference.

## Tasks

### WEB-01: Quick fix so the package upload reaches a real project
Status: doing (code in place 2026-10-01; the staging upload is not verified) · Phase 0 · Size S · Depends: DB-01 · Blocks: WEB-08
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): retired. The project comes from the route and the token from the signed-in person. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIELDMAPS_PROJECT_ID` variable, the site-code stopgap and the pasted token are gone.
Progress 2026-10-01: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIELDMAPS_PROJECT_ID` with a UUID check, a site-code input, a multi-file drop zone with an instant layer map and browser checks. `qgis/fall-creek/upload-sample/` passes the browser checks and the API's `prepare()` run directly; no upload against staging has been made.
Superseded later by WEB-08, which takes the project and site from the route.
Read first: `src/components/basemaps/PackageUpload.tsx`, `src/lib/packages.ts`, `src/data/project.ts`.
Do:
1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIELDMAPS_PROJECT_ID`, a UUID. When it is set, the upload uses it instead of `PROJECT.id`.
2. Replace the fixture site dropdown with a text input for the site code. Default it to `sample-garden`, and show a note that site lists arrive with WEB-08.
3. Keep the pasted-token stopgap and its notice until WEB-06.
4. Document the variable in `web/README.md`.

Done when: against staging, where DB-01 is applied, a manager token uploads a package and the screen shows the server's checks.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, plus a manual upload against staging recorded in the task notes.

### WEB-02: Service worker, manifest and indexing safety
Status: done · Phase 0 · Size S · Depends: none · Blocks: WEB-10
Verified 2026-10-04: 30 auth/worker tests, web typecheck/lint and production builds passed under Node 24.18.0. Consecutive rebuilds rotated worker tokens from `703ee8d0-f836-4791-b0c7-05a36e4fdb12` to `5080ce95-4057-4789-861a-c2b5170f14fc`. The second build used a temporary deployment ID, confirming rotation even when Next ignores `generateBuildId`. On the local production server at port 3014, curl returned `Allow: /$`, `Allow: /privacy*`, `Disallow: /`; the manifest opened `/o`, and `/sw.js` returned JavaScript with `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`. Production startup preserved the worker token. Activation removes the legacy `fieldmaps-shell-v1` cache and older DECA Mark public caches while preserving unrelated caches. No hosted deployment or browser/device installation was verified.

Do:
1. Changes to `public/sw.js`:
   - add the build id to the cache name;
   - never cache `/_next/data`, `?_rsc`, `/api`, or any cross-origin request;
   - keep the app shell network-first.
2. Point the manifest's `start_url` at `/o`, where WEB-06 will redirect to the last project.
3. Add `src/app/robots.ts`: allow only `/` and `/privacy*`; disallow everything else.

Done when: after a rebuild the cache name changes, and `curl localhost:3000/robots.txt` shows the rules.

### WEB-03: Supabase SSR foundation and proxy
Status: done · Phase 1 · Size M · Depends: DB-02 · Blocks: OPS-05, WEB-04, WEB-05, WEB-16
Verified 2026-10-04: unauthenticated `/o` returns 307 to `/sign-in?next=%2Fo`; real local sign-up/code verification reaches the protected onboarding page and `/account`. Claims are checked again in server components and the API client. Production build lists these routes as dynamic. Public Supabase dependencies were already exactly pinned.

Read first: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs>; <https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy>.
Do:
1. Add `@supabase/ssr` and `@supabase/supabase-js`, with exact versions pinned in `web/package.json`.
2. Create `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` with `createServerClient`, using `cookies()` `getAll`/`setAll`, and `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` with `createBrowserClient`.
3. Create `src/proxy.ts`. It refreshes the session cookies and redirects unauthenticated requests for `/o/**`, `/onboarding` and `/account` to `/sign-in?next=…`.
4. Also check auth inside every server component and Server Action that reads tenant data, with a `requireUser()` helper that uses `getClaims()`. The proxy alone is not enough.
5. Add the env vars `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, documented in `web/README.md`.

Done when: an unauthenticated visit to `/o` redirects to sign-in, and a signed-in visit passes.

### WEB-04: Authentication pages
Status: doing · Phase 1 · Size M · Depends: DB-02, WEB-03 · Blocks: WEB-06, WEB-15
Verified 2026-10-04 against local Supabase and Mailpit: browser sign-up, resend, six-digit verification, live account and account-menu sign-out. The automated real Server Action flow additionally verifies unconfirmed-account errors, invalid codes, resend cooldown, recovery code plus password update, same-password rejection followed by successful retry without a new code, rejection of mismatched recovery user/session/email, rejection of the old password, acceptance of the new password, and safe fallback for an external `next`. Emails stay in httpOnly cookies. `DECAMARK_AUTH_LOCAL_TEST=1 pnpm --dir web test:auth:local` passed. No hosted auth verification or deployment is claimed.
Remaining (2026-10-04): the `authenticate` and `signOut` Server Actions are done and tested; their first pages were plain. The Contour screens from WEB-21 replace those pages at the same URLs and now post to the same actions, with the same field names and messages. This task is done when the Contour screens pass the flows above. Password rule: 8 to 128 characters everywhere (D25).

Do: wire these pages to Supabase Auth. WEB-21 builds them in Contour on fixtures; keep its layout, copy and 44 px targets:
- `/sign-up`: email and password (8 characters or more), then `signUp`, then `/verify`.
  - The email travels in `sessionStorage` or an httpOnly cookie, never in the URL. URLs end up in request logs, history and Sentry breadcrumbs.
- `/verify`: 6-digit code, `verifyOtp({type: 'email'})`, and resend with a cooldown.
- `/sign-in`: distinct errors for wrong credentials, unconfirmed email (links to verify), and rate limiting.
- `/forgot-password` → `/reset-password`: code, then new password (`verifyOtp({type: 'recovery'})`, then `updateUser`).
- Sign-out from the account menu.

After sign-in, go to `next`, the last project, or `/onboarding`.

Done when: every flow works against the local stack, with codes read from Mailpit.

### WEB-05: Server-side API client
Status: done · Phase 1 · Size M · Depends: BE-06, CON-03, CON-04, WEB-03 · Blocks: WEB-06, WEB-12, WEB-27
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): kept. `NEXT_PUBLIC_DECAMARK_API_URL` is not removed: the browser uses it to send map packages (up to 24 MiB) and fetch their archives straight from the API, as step 3 allowed. Server components and Server Actions use `DECAMARK_API_URL`. The client also gained cached reads (`lib/api/workspace.ts`), one function per write (`lib/api/mutations.ts`) and a 15-second timeout for each request.
Verified 2026-10-04: authenticated `/account` renders real `/v1/me` profile and membership counts from the local API, in both browser and automated HTTP acceptance. Generated endpoint types, runtime identity parsing, no-store requests and a 15-second timeout are in place. Large package uploads remain direct browser-to-API, retaining CORS and the public API origin to avoid introducing a web proxy body-size limit. `pnpm --dir web check`, `build`, `test:auth` (11 tests) and `test:api-errors` (31 tests including HTML 200 response handling) passed.

Do:
1. Create `src/lib/api/client.ts` and mark it `server-only`. It fetches `DECAMARK_API_URL` (a server environment variable, not `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) with the session's access token and `cache: 'no-store'`, typed by the generated `schema.d.ts`. It maps the error envelope to typed errors (`errors.ts`).
2. Mutations go through Server Actions that call this client. Each action checks auth itself.
3. Make one exception: large package uploads may post from the browser directly to the API. They need CORS, which `browser_origins` already covers. Alternatively, the upload goes through a Route Handler proxy, which also needs a body-size decision. Record the choice in this task's notes.
4. Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_DECAMARK_API_URL` once nothing reads it.

Done when: one server component renders `/v1/me` data, and the typecheck passes against the generated types.

### WEB-06: Onboarding, organization and project routes, account page
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: BE-06, BE-07, BE-08, WEB-04, WEB-05 · Blocks: WEB-07, WEB-08, WEB-09, WEB-10, WEB-11, WEB-14, WEB-15
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered, except the set-up. `/o` opens the person's last project, their only project or their first organization. The organization and project routes and switchers come from `/v1/me`. Owners and admins create projects from the organization's Projects page. `/invite` and `/join` preview and redeem real invitations. The organization and the project have `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx` and not-found pages. `/account` was already live. Retired: `/onboarding` and creating an organization on the web (the bootstrap script does that).
Do:
1. `/onboarding`:
   - create an org (name, auto slug) and the first project (name, code, timezone) through `POST /v1/orgs`;
   - or show "You were invited? Open your invitation link."
2. `/invite` (the token in the URL **fragment**, `/invite#t=…`):
   - The fragment never reaches the server, the logs or the referrer.
   - The page reads it client-side and keeps it in `sessionStorage` through sign-up or sign-in. `next` points at `/invite`, without the token.
   - Then it calls `POST /v1/invitations/preview`, and shows "Join {project} ({org}) as {role}?".
   - `POST /v1/invitations/redeem` runs only on that confirmation. Opening a link never enrols anyone silently.
   - Set `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on `/invite` and `/verify`.
   - Add a Sentry `beforeBreadcrumb` rule that drops URLs under `/invite` and any `email` parameter (WEB-16).
3. `/o/[org]` lists the projects and org settings, including org members when the user is an admin.
4. The workspace sections live under `/o/[org]/p/[project]/…` with the D21 slugs (`data`, `sites`, `forms`, `team`, `qgis`, `reports`, `settings`), and the old paths redirect; WEB-22 builds both. Resolve the org and project from the route and `/v1/me` instead of the fixture slugs. Keep the fixture reads and the Preview data marker (D20) until WEB-08 to WEB-12 wire each screen.
5. Header: the org and project switcher from `/v1/me`, and the account menu. Remove the `VIEWER` fixture, and the marketing page's `ORGANIZATION.name`; the landing page names the product, not a tenant.
6. `/account`: profile (`PATCH /v1/me`) and delete account.
   - Deletion calls `DELETE /v1/me` behind a two-step confirm, with a `sole_owner` message.
   - On 202, show "Deletion is finishing" and retry up to 3 times over about 30 seconds while the session is valid.
   - Then sign out (204 or 202 alike).
   - The server keeps the durable record (BE-08).
7. Add `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, and a `loading.tsx` for each section.

Done when: J1 steps 1–2 work end to end against the local stack, and the old URLs redirect.

### WEB-07: Team page (members, invitations, join codes)
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size M · Depends: BE-07, WEB-06 · Blocks: WEB-15
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on live data for a project (Team) and for an organization (Members): the list, role change, remove, an invitation by link or by an 8-character code (shown once, with "DECA Mark does not send email"), pending invitations and revoke. Not built: the QR code (dropped), devices (DB-10) and resending an invitation ("not available yet"). Nobody becomes an owner by a role change; ownership moves only by Transfer ownership in the organization's Settings.
Do:
1. List members with their role, and let a manager change a role or remove someone.
   - The UI blocks removing the last manager, and the API enforces it too.
   - On the organization page (`/o/[org]`), owners and admins manage org members the same way. Only owners see `admin` and `owner` controls, and ownership moves only through "Transfer ownership".
2. Invitations, for a project (project roles) or, on the organization page, for the org (`member` or `admin`):
   - create one with a role, an optional email, a use limit and an expiry;
   - show the link (`/invite#t=…`) and the 8-character code **once**, with copy buttons and a QR code of `decamark://join?code=`;
   - list active invitations and revoke them.
3. Observer devices come from DB-10 `devices`, once it exists.

Done when: a manager creates a code on the web and an observer redeems it on mobile (MOB-06).

### WEB-08: Sites and packages on real data
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size M · Depends: BE-13, WEB-01, WEB-06 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered. Sites lists and creates sites (code, name, description). A site draws its plan from the current package. Map packages show the history, the server's checks, an upload from QGIS layers and a download. The browser sends the package straight to the API. The pasted token, the project ID variable and the fixture packages are gone. "Activate" is dropped: the newest ready package is current. Deleting a site or a package is "not available yet".
Do:
1. `sites`:
   - list from the API;
   - a manager can create a site (code, name, timezone);
   - `sites/[site]` shows the zones (real polygons) on the map, the package versions with their checks, and the current version.
2. Move `PackageUpload` here and delete the pasted token. The site code comes from the route, the project UUID from the route, and the token from the session.
3. Offer a package download through the `archive` route.
4. Stop these screens reading fixtures. The Preview data marker stays until no screen reads fixtures (D20).
   - Delete `src/data/basemaps.ts`.
   - Replace `src/data/site-geometry.ts` in `ZonePlan` and `project.ts` with zones and ground from the sites API.
   - Delete any part of `src/data/project.ts` that nothing uses.

Done when: J1 step 3 works, and no fixture remains on these routes.

### WEB-09: Instrument on real data
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size M · Depends: BE-11, WEB-06, WEB-10 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered. Forms lists forms and starts a new one from a template (Behaviour mapping, Zone inventory, Blank). Form versions starts a draft, discards it or retires a version. The draft editor saves to the server and shows the server's validation message. Publish shows the protocol notes and says how observers receive the form. Not built: importing a draft by pasting or uploading JSON (templates replace it).
Cut option: if the schedule slips, keep this screen read-only and seed Janet's version with a migration.
Do:
1. Forms, then versions, each with its state. Show a version's questions and display rules, read from the definition.
2. Manager actions:
   - import a draft (paste or upload JSON) and show every validation problem;
   - publish, then retire.
3. Stop this screen reading fixtures; the Preview data marker stays until no screen does (D20). This task owns deleting `src/data/instrument.ts`: after WEB-10 has moved `FilterRail` and the markers off it, remove every remaining import and the file.

Done when: Janet's definition from `contracts/forms/` imports and publishes locally.

### WEB-10: Observations on real data
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size L · Depends: BE-14, WEB-02, WEB-06 · Blocks: WEB-09, WEB-13
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on the newest 500 observations. The API has no cursor, so there is no paging, viewport query or clustering. Site and round filters ask the server. Zone, observer, day and search filters work on the loaded rows and live in the URL. The page has a table, a site plan with markers when one site is chosen, a record page worded from the form version the record used, and Export. `LeafletCanvas`, `FilterRail` and the fixture observations are gone. Dates use the project's timezone.
Read first: `src/components/observations/*`, `src/lib/filters.ts`.
Do:
1. Keep the filters in the URL, now project-scoped. Load one page at a time with a cursor.
2. Map:
   - query by viewport bbox;
   - cluster markers (replacing the one-DOM-marker-per-record approach, `LeafletCanvas.tsx:149-163`);
   - show zones from the site's current package.
3. The table is virtualized, or paged at 100 rows. The detail pane reads from the API.
4. Fix the mislabel: `Rel_Round` is not the collection round (`ObservationDetail.tsx:59`).
5. Replace every remaining fixture read on this screen:
   - `FilterRail`'s zone, round and observer options come from the zones API and the summary (BE-14);
   - its play types and quality flags come from the form definition, not `src/data/instrument.ts`;
   - marker shapes (`markers.ts`, `shapeForPlayType`) come from the definition;
   - dates use the project's or site's timezone from the API, not `SITE_TIME_ZONE` (`src/lib/format.ts`, `ObservationDetail`).
6. Delete `src/data/observations.ts`, and stop `LeafletCanvas` importing `src/data/site-geometry.ts`. Only then is this screen off fixtures.

Done when: 10,000 synthetic observations on the local stack scroll and filter smoothly, and the filters survive a page reload.

### WEB-11: Overview on real data
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size M · Depends: BE-14, WEB-06 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered without a summary endpoint. The overview works out the field return, the coverage of zones by Standard, Reliability and Inventory rounds, what needs attention and the recent activity in the web app, from the site list and the newest 500 observations. At the cap it says "Based on the newest 500 observations." No completion target is claimed.
Cut option: show counts only, without charts.
Do: fill WEB-23's overview (counts, `TypeBars` and the coverage matrix) from `GET …/summary`, keeping its layout; `DESIGN.md` rules out KPI tiles. Delete client-side aggregation over fixtures (`src/lib/analysis.ts`) that nothing uses anymore.

Done when: the overview matches SQL counts on the local stack.

### WEB-12: GIS page and exports
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size S · Depends: BE-14, BE-15, GIS-01, GIS-04, WEB-05 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered in the browser. CSV, GeoJSON and the codebook are built by `lib/export` from the loaded observations, follow the site and round filters, and say "Based on the newest 500 observations." at the cap. The QGIS page lists each site's current package with a download. Not built: server-side exports and the connection panel. "Connecting QGIS directly to the database" says it is not available yet and points to exporting a file.
Do:
1. Export buttons (CSV, GeoJSON) that apply the current filters and call BE-14's server exports.
   - Delete the client-side generation over fixtures (`src/lib/exports.ts`).
   - Once `site-geometry.ts` has no importers left (WEB-08, WEB-10), delete it too.
2. The QGIS connection panel reads from `/gis-access`: public settings only, the per-project service name, and the typed layer names. Link to the `qgis/README.md` steps.

Done when: the exported CSV opens with the codebook columns, and the panel shows the real settings for a project with a grant.

### WEB-13: Tablet layout and touch targets
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size M · Depends: WEB-10 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): not part of this task. WEB-27's screens are built to fit 390 px, and the Playwright honesty scan in `web/e2e` screenshots every route at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390 in Day and Dusk. The audit of 44 px targets at 768×1024, 1024×768 and 1280×800 is still open.
Do:
1. Observations: two panes (map and table) from `md`, with detail as a sheet. Three panes at `xl`.
2. Every control is at least 44 px tall (`RailNav.tsx:31`, `chrome.tsx:171,423`, `ObservationsWorkspace.tsx:102`, `PackageUpload.tsx:145`).
3. Check at 768×1024, 1024×768 and 1280×800 using the `responsiveness-check` skill.

Done when: there is no horizontal scroll and no clipped pane at those three sizes. Record screenshots in the task notes.

### WEB-14: Legal pages for public sign-up
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size S · Depends: WEB-06 · Blocks: OPS-11
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): not changed. The legal layout only takes the new header mark (D29).
Read first: `src/app/(legal)/privacy/page.tsx` (`:78-80` and `:281` say administrators create accounts); `src/app/(legal)/policy.ts`.
Do:
1. Describe public sign-up, email-code verification, and what data an account holds.
2. Describe the Training project and its 30-day retention. The retention period depends on Q2.
3. State that a user can delete their account in the app, or signed in on the web at `/account`.
4. Make `/privacy/delete-data` work **without the app**, to meet the Play requirement: signed-in users get the deletion flow; signed-out users get instructions and a contact.
5. Keep the "to be confirmed" markers wherever a value is still open.

Done when: nothing on the page contradicts public sign-up, and the deletion path works without the app.

### WEB-15: End-to-end tests with Playwright
Status: todo · Phase 4 · Size M · Depends: DB-02, WEB-04, WEB-06, WEB-07 · Blocks: QA-04
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): partly delivered. `web/e2e` and `scripts/e2e-local.sh` run Playwright against local Supabase, the local API and the seed in `database/seed-web-workspace.mjs`. Specs: sign-in, sites, packages, forms, data, overview, QGIS and reports, settings, team, organization pages, an invitation redeemed by a viewer, an observer joining by code, the removed routes, and a scan of every route for sample words, jargon, more than one primary button and axe findings in Day and Dusk. Not covered: sign-up with Mailpit codes, password reset and account deletion. There is no onboarding to test.
Do: add `web/e2e/`, running against the local stack and reading codes from the Mailpit API. Cover:
- sign-up, verify, onboarding, then the org and project exist;
- sign in and reset password;
- invitation link redemption by a second user;
- a manager creates a join code;
- account deletion.

Done when: the suite passes locally and in CI (OPS-06).

### WEB-16: Web error reporting
Status: todo · Phase 4 · Size S · Depends: OPS-07, WEB-03 · Blocks: QA-06
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): not changed.
Do:
1. Add `@sentry/nextjs` for server, edge and browser.
   - Server and edge read `SENTRY_DSN`.
   - The browser reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`, which is fixed at build time (OPS-05). A DSN is public.
2. Apply the OPS-07 scrubbing:
   - no request bodies;
   - no `answers`;
   - no emails;
   - a `beforeBreadcrumb` rule that drops `/invite` URLs and `email` parameters (WEB-06).
3. Add a hidden `/account/sentry-test` action, for signed-in platform admins only, that throws once.

Done when: a server-side and a browser-side test error from the preview deployment both appear in Sentry, with no personal data in their breadcrumbs.


### WEB-17: Form Studio: the canonical form, a live collector preview, and local drafts
Status: done (2026-10-01) · Phase 1 · Size M · Depends: CON-02 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): drafts moved to the server. The browser-only drafts, the change list, the `.json` download and the `/instrument` studio (`components/studio/*`) are retired. A draft is saved to the API, published and retired from Forms. Kept: the parser and engine in `src/lib/forms/` (`pnpm forms:parity`) and the collector view in the draft editor, which runs the same engine.
Added 2026-10-01 to show Janet her form as the collector asks it, before the instrument API exists. WEB-09 later swaps the source from `contracts/forms/` to the API and adds publishing; the studio's UI stays.
Read first: `contracts/README.md`; `mobile/src/forms/{definition,engine}.ts`; `mobile/src/components/question-panel.tsx`.
Do:
1. Copy the form parser and engine to `web/src/lib/forms/`, byte-identical below a header, with `pnpm forms:parity` checking it. Add `loadDefinition()`, which returns every problem instead of throwing.
2. `/instrument` reads `contracts/forms/*.json` at build time and renders each question in authored order: kind, required, display rule as a sentence, options, dynamic option sets, export column, open protocol questions.
3. A phone preview (`src/components/studio/PhonePreview.tsx`) runs the same engine: one question per screen, auto-advance on single choice, review, saved, and the export columns an answer lands in.
4. Customize a draft in place: wording, guidance, required, option labels (codes never follow a relabel), new options, order, simple display rules, new questions with no invented export column. A published version is read-only; changing it starts a new draft beside it.
5. Drafts stay in this browser (`localStorage`, guarded) with a change list against the shipped file and a `.json` download. No publish control pretends to work.

Done when: Janet's form renders from `contracts/forms/janet-test-v1.json`, branching on the phone matches the device, an edit appears on the phone at once, and the change list names it.

Verify: `pnpm forms:parity`, `pnpm --dir web check`, and a browser pass recorded here.

Verified 2026-10-01: the web copy matches mobile byte for byte and replays all 39 `janet-test-v1` contract cases; `pnpm --dir web check` passes. In the browser, Janet's form renders from the contract, choosing Imaginative reveals its own subtype list, an added option and a required toggle reach the phone at once and appear in the change list, review blocks a save on missing required answers, and the saved screen lists the export columns. No horizontal scroll at 1440, 1024 or 768 px.

### WEB-18: Set-up flow preview (organization, project, site, form, invitation)
Status: done (2026-10-01) · Phase 1 · Size S · Depends: none · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): retired. `/onboarding`, `features/onboarding` and `components/onboarding` are deleted, with every link to them. Organizations come from `scripts/bootstrap-study.mjs`. Owners create projects on the organization's Projects page. Sites, forms and the team are created in their own tabs.
Added 2026-10-01 for the J1 walkthrough with Janet. A clickable preview at `/onboarding` that saves nothing and says so; WEB-06 and WEB-07 replace its "Continue" steps with the real calls once BE-07 exists.
Do: five steps (organization and slug, first project and timezone, site and the QGIS layers it needs, starting form, observer join code), a live "what this creates" panel, links into `/basemaps` and `/instrument`, and a phone mock of the collector's join screen. No control is labelled as creating anything.

Done when: every step is keyboard reachable, the banner states that nothing is saved, and the page passes `pnpm --dir web check`.

Verified 2026-10-01: all five steps walked in the browser (slug and project code derive from the names, a join code is generated, the join-screen mock names the project and org), the page is `noindex`, every control is at least 44 px tall, and `pnpm --dir web check` passes.

### WEB-19: Map palettes on the web maps (Day, Night)
Status: done (2026-10-01) · Phase 1 · Size S · Depends: none · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): the Leaflet maps are retired: the observations map, the package-upload preview and the tile layers. `leaflet` and `react-leaflet` are removed. Plans are the SVG `SitePlan` and `MapFrame`, which keep the Day and Night palettes from `contracts/map-palettes.json`.
Added 2026-10-01 with MOB-22 (decision D18). The observations map and the package-upload preview read `contracts/map-palettes.json` through `src/lib/map-palette.ts`; a Day · Night switch on the observations map is shared by both maps and remembered in the browser. Light or dark CARTO tiles follow the palette.
Verified 2026-10-01: `pnpm --dir web check` passes; in the browser the switch flips the site fill between the Day and Night colours and the choice survives a reload. The ground repaint around the site on a palette change was not seen in a browser (the pane was hidden).

### WEB-20: Contour foundation (web)
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: none · Blocks: WEB-21, WEB-22
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): the temporary parts are gone: the fixture scaffold (`src/fixtures`, `lib/preview.ts`), the Nocturne alias block in `globals.css`, `components/nocturne` and `src/data`. The ESLint rule now bans `@/fixtures`, `@/data` and `@/lib/preview` in place of the Nocturne-era modules. The tokens and `/dev/contour` are unchanged.
Added 2026-10-03 (D19, D22). It builds no product screen. The screens built on it (WEB-21 to WEB-26) run on fixtures; the wiring tasks WEB-04 to WEB-13 later connect real data to them without changing their layout.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`, `contracts/contour.json`, `contracts/map-palettes.json`; designs: Contour system pp. 1–12.
Do:
1. Tokens. `scripts/contour-tokens.mjs` generates `src/styles/contour.css` (`--ct-*` on `:root` for Day and on `[data-theme="dusk"]`); `--check` fails on drift and on contrast below 4.5:1 for text or 3:1 for UI, in both themes. Root scripts `pnpm tokens` and `pnpm tokens:check`. `globals.css` maps the variables to Tailwind utilities with `@theme inline`. A temporary block of Nocturne-name aliases keeps untouched screens readable until WEB-26 deletes it.
2. Fonts: Geologica and Spline Sans Mono through `next/font/google` as `--font-sans` and `--font-mono`, falling back to vendored woff2 through `next/font/local` if the fetch is blocked.
3. Theme. An inline `<head>` script reads `localStorage["fm-theme"]` (Day by default) and sets `data-theme`, `colorScheme`, the theme-color meta and `data-platform` before first paint; `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>`; no cookies, so static pages stay static. `manifest.ts` and `viewport` take the Contour colours.
4. Dependencies: `lucide-react`, `radix-ui` and `cmdk`; dev `@playwright/test` and `@axe-core/playwright`. Motion is CSS only, from the motion tokens, and every movement has a reduced-motion fallback.
5. Primitives in `src/components/contour/*`, with the same names as `mobile/src/ui/*`: actions, containers, state, inputs, navigation, data and feedback, as listed in `DESIGN.md`. `Icon` maps the Lucide names in the state vocabulary of `contracts/contour.json` and adds the custom two-bar held glyph. State is always a glyph, a word and a colour from that vocabulary.
6. Maps. `components/map/SitePlan` is a server-renderable SVG drawn from the palette and the site GeoJSON (`lib/plan.ts` projects any GeoJSON). The client `MapFrame` adds keyboard zoom and pan, round + / − buttons, the Layers popover (Day · Night), the label island, the scale chip, hatched focus zones and violet markers. The shared Riverside plan moves to `contracts/fixtures/sites/riverside.json`.
7. The fixture scaffold in `src/fixtures/*` (`PREVIEW_NOW`, every time in an explicit timezone, U2–U7 concepts in tagged types), `lib/{theme,preview,plan,time}.ts`, and an ESLint `no-restricted-imports` rule that stops new imports of `@/data/*` and `nocturne/*`.
8. `/dev/contour`: every primitive in Day and Dusk, `noindex`, dev and preview builds only. Add the Playwright harness in `web/e2e/` (against `next start`, service workers blocked) that screenshots a route at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390 in both themes.

Done when: the gallery renders every primitive in Day and Dusk; `pnpm tokens:check` passes, contrast included; the existing routes still build.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of `/dev/contour` against the Contour system pages.

### WEB-21: Identity screens on Contour (web)
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-20 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered. `/invite` and `/join` preview and redeem real invitations. The token stays in the URL fragment and the code never goes in the URL. The group `(auth)/(signed-in)` is now `(auth)/(join)`, because the pages also serve signed-out visitors. Joining again as an existing member is answered 404 by the API, and the join page says the person may already be a member. Retired: the `(onboarding)` frame and `/onboarding/[step]`, the Preview data footer line and the `?preview-state` demo screens.
Added 2026-10-03. WEB-04 (sign-up, sign-in, codes, passwords) connects them to the Supabase Server Actions at the same URLs, and WEB-06 (onboarding, invitation) connects them to the API, without changing their layout.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`; designs: Contour system p. 12, Organization, auth and public pp. 6–13; `src/components/onboarding/*` (WEB-18).
Do:
1. Layouts: `(auth)/(signed-out)` (split layout with the SitePlan hero island and a Privacy link), `(auth)/(signed-in)` (split layout with the account chip and "Not you?") and the `(onboarding)` stepper frame, each with the Preview data footer line.
2. `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/verify`, `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password`. A code is one wide mono field with a counter ("4 of 6"): a paste is cleaned, the field submits by itself at the 6th digit, a wrong code reselects it, and "Resend in 0:24" counts down in mono. Password checks update live, "Does not match yet" appears only after blur, and a disabled button always carries its reason.
3. `/invite` ("Join Play Study?", the token in the URL fragment) and `/join` (PROPOSAL U3, with its flag; join codes are uppercased as you type).
4. `/onboarding/[step]` for organization, project, site, form and team, keeping WEB-18's `SetupFlow` logic and its rule that no control claims to create anything.
5. Every error state in the designs, in Contour wording: what happened, what is safe, what to do.

Done when: each screen matches its design page at 1440 and 390 in Day and Dusk; codes paste and submit by themselves; every error state can be shown in the preview.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of each route against its design page, with axe failing on serious or critical findings.

### WEB-22: Workspace shell and navigation
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-20 · Blocks: WEB-23, WEB-24, WEB-25, WEB-26, WEB-27
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on live data. The switchers, the account menu (real name, email and initials), the tabs by role, ⌘K and the shortcuts read `/v1/me` through `WorkspaceProvider`. ⌘K covers tabs, organizations, projects and the account, not sites, people or `OBS-` ids. Retired: the Preview data marker and footer, View as and Show state, the session-only store, the Form library tab, and Create project in the switcher (it is on the organization's Projects page). The old paths redirect to `/o`.
Added 2026-10-03 (D20, D21). WEB-03's proxy now guards it (with the D23 preview bypass), and WEB-06 (switchers and account menu from `/v1/me`) connects it to real organizations and projects without changing its layout.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`; designs: Contour system pp. 5, 6 and 10, Organization, auth and public pp. 1, 18 and 19.
Do:
1. The `(app)` layouts: `/account` and `/o/[org]` with the header and no tabs; `(org)` with the org tabs (Projects, Members, Form library, Settings); `(project)` with the project tabs (Overview, Data, Sites, Forms, Team, QGIS, Reports, Settings).
2. Header: the org and project switchers (menus with typeahead, role and state, Create project last); "Search or jump to" (⌘K) over tabs, projects, sites, zones, form versions, people and `OBS-` ids, with the actions Day · Dusk, map palette, Export current view and Invite member, and recent items; the account menu with Day · Dusk.
3. InkTabs: the white current-tab pill slides inside the ink bar, with no slide on first paint; narrow screens scroll the tabs with edge fades. Shortcuts: `g` then `o/d/s/f/t/q/r`, `?` for the list, `/` for search. A skip link, and focus moves to the page heading on navigation.
4. The Preview data marker, a mono pill in the header. Its popover reads "Everything here is sample data. Nothing is read from or written to the DECA Mark database." In dev and preview builds it also offers View as (`?as=viewer|observer`), Show state (`?preview-state=`) and Theme. One footer line says the same. Preview actions go into a `sessionStorage` store, take effect on screen, reset on reload and never claim a server round trip.
5. Redirects in `next.config.ts` (307, query string kept) from `/overview`, `/observations`, `/places`, `/basemaps`, `/instrument` and `/qgis` to the new routes.
6. The org-level 404 and error pages (the org header without tabs; the error page with "What we know" and a reference), and the org Projects page.
7. Delete `(workspace)`, `RailNav` and `StatusFooter`. Cached Nocturne pages are dropped by WEB-02's per-build worker cache, which replaced a manual `CACHE_NAME` bump.

Done when: the old paths redirect; the skip link, tabs, ⌘K and menus work by keyboard alone; `?as=viewer` hides Team and Settings; axe is clean in both themes.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of each route against its design page, plus a scripted keyboard run.

### WEB-23: Project screens: field return (overview, data, observation)
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-22 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on live data (the overview as in WEB-11, the data page and record as in WEB-10). Retired: approve and exclude with undo ("Reviewing or excluding observations is not available yet"; every uploaded observation is in the exports), the session-only Save view ("Copy link to this view" replaces it) and the record's history, which has no audit log behind it.
Added 2026-10-03. These screens run on fixtures. WEB-10 (data), WEB-11 (overview) and WEB-12 (exports) later connect real data to them without changing their layout.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`; designs: Project workspace pp. 1–3, Contour system p. 8; `src/lib/filters.ts`, `src/lib/analysis.ts`, `src/lib/exports.ts`.
Do:
1. Overview (project root), "What came back from the field": coverage and what is blocking. Every count comes from the fixture rows through `lib/analysis.ts` and `lib/filters.ts` (14 observations; play types 5/4/3/2; observers JL 6, PS 4, AK 4; coverage 5 of 9 zone-rounds).
2. Data: filters in the URL that update at once, "14 of 14 shown" in a live region, and Clear filters returning focus to the first filter. `MapFrame` and `DataTable` share a two-way selection: the row scrolls into view, the map eases only when the marker is off-screen, and a selection that leaves the view clears with "OBS-0244 is not in this view".
3. The selected-record panel. `j`/`k` or ↑/↓ move the selection, Enter opens, `a` approves and `x` excludes; the toast reads "OBS-0244 approved · Undo" (6 s), ⌘Z also undoes, and focus stays on the row. These are session-only preview actions.
4. Save view (session only), and Export through a dialog that reuses `lib/exports.ts` and repeats the scope.
5. `data/[observation]`: every answer, the context, the location and the history.
6. Every data area has its loading, empty, filtered, error, offline and no-access states. At 768 Data shows the map and table with the selected record in a dialog; at 390 tables become row cards.

Done when: the numbers match the designs; the selection rules hold; the `j/k`, `a/x` and undo keyboard run passes.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of each route × preview state against its design page.

### WEB-24: Project screens: places (sites, site, zone, zone editor, map packages)
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-22 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on live data: Sites, Site and Map packages (history, inspect, upload, download). Retired: the Zone page and the zone editor (U2; "Editing zones on the web is not available yet": edit zones in QGIS and upload a new package, and zone rows link to Data filtered by zone), Device readiness (not available yet) and "Activate" (the newest ready package is current).
Added 2026-10-03. These screens run on fixtures. WEB-08 (sites and packages) and WEB-10 (zone data) later connect real data to them without changing their layout. The package upload stays real: it keeps `lib/packages.ts` and says "Sends this package to the DECA Mark API."
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`; designs: Project workspace pp. 6–10; `src/components/basemaps/PackageUpload.tsx`, `src/lib/packages.ts`.
Do:
1. Sites, and Site: zones on the `SitePlan`, coverage, packages and its data. Device readiness always reads "as last reported".
2. Zone (`sites/[site]/zones/[zone]`): the data and coverage inside one zone.
3. Edit zone boundaries (`sites/[site]/zones/edit`, PROPOSAL U2, with its flag). Handles are focusable buttons: arrows nudge 1 map unit and Shift+arrow 10; Delete removes a vertex but keeps at least three. Edits sync both ways with the vertex table, ⌘Z undoes, and Discard confirms. Edits are session-only.
4. Map packages (`sites/[site]/packages?step=`). The step lives in the URL, so back works. Inspection rows support a "Checking" state, and the fixtures show the final state. "Activate v4" turns v3 into Archived, session only. Step 1's dialog keeps the real upload and previews the layers with `SitePlan`.

Done when: vertex editing works by keyboard; `?step` back navigation works; the upload still reaches the API.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of each route against its design page.

### WEB-25: Project screens: forms, team, QGIS, reports, settings
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-22 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered on live data: Forms, Form versions, the draft editor, Publish, Team, QGIS, Reports and Settings. Reports is one page with Print. Retired: saved views (`reports/views`), the separate printable report (`reports/[report]`), Rounds (`settings/rounds`, U6), the join-code island, QGIS reader grants and the type-to-confirm danger zone. "Saved report views", "Planning rounds", "Deleting a project" and "Connecting QGIS directly to the database" say they are not available yet. Archive and Unarchive remain.
Added 2026-10-03. These screens run on fixtures. WEB-09 (forms), WEB-07 (team) and WEB-12 (QGIS) later connect real data to them without changing their layout. Reports (U7) and rounds (U6) are proposals and always show their flags.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`; designs: Project workspace pp. 4, 5 and 11–19; `src/components/studio/PhonePreview.tsx`, `src/lib/forms/*`.
Do:
1. Forms, Form versions (with the `janet-test-v1` draft and its 8 protocol notes), the draft editor (`forms/versions/[version]`, read-only once published) and Review publication (`…/publish`). The confirm checkbox enables "Publish demo-v2", and the reason shows until then; afterwards the version history updates, session only.
2. A new `CollectorPreview` on a `usePreviewSession` hook taken out of `PhonePreview`'s engine wiring, with a Phone · Tablet toggle, scoped to Day. The engine files in `src/lib/forms/` stay untouched.
3. Team: members, roles, invitations and the join code. Copy turns into "Copied ✓", Download saves a `.txt`, and Dismiss confirms; the island then collapses to "Code dismissed · Rotate code".
4. QGIS: maps in (packages by site) and evidence out (publishing, access, exports).
5. Reports, Saved views (`reports/views`) and the printable site summary (`reports/[report]`: `@page` A4, forced Day, no ledges).
6. Project settings and Rounds (`settings/rounds`). Unsaved changes replace "Last saved yesterday by JL" with "Unsaved changes", and leaving the page asks first. The danger zone lists every affected resource before the type-to-confirm button.

Done when: `pnpm forms:parity` passes with the engine files untouched; the print preview of the site summary fits one A4 page.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of each route against its design page, plus a print-to-PDF of the site summary.

### WEB-26: Organization, account and public pages, and retiring Nocturne and Leaflet
Status: todo · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-22 · Blocks: none
WEB-27 (2026-10-09, D30): delivered: the organization's Projects, Members and Settings on live data (Transfer ownership for owners; "Deleting an organization" is not available yet), the observer handoff at `/o/[org]/collect` (the person's own observer projects, with the Android link when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANDROID_APP_URL` is set), the home page and the not-found page. `/account` was already live. Retired: the Form library (U4; `/o/[org]/library` redirects to the organization), the join QR code, `src/data/*`, `components/nocturne`, the Nocturne CSS aliases, `leaflet` and `react-leaflet`. The route groups are `(marketing)` and `(legal)`, not `(public)`.
Added 2026-10-03. These screens run on fixtures. WEB-06 (org pages, account), WEB-07 (members) and WEB-14 (privacy wording) later connect them without changing their layout.
Read first: `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `web/AGENTS.md`; designs: Organization, auth and public pp. 1–5 and 14–19.
Do:
1. Org Members, Form library (`/o/[org]/library`, PROPOSAL U4, with its flag) and Org settings.
2. `/account` (the header, no tabs): profile, password, sign out, delete account. No control claims a deletion it does not perform.
3. `/o/[org]/collect`, the observer handoff "You collect in the app" (PROPOSAL U3; the org header without tabs). `?as=observer` lands here.
4. Landing, Privacy and Request data deletion in the `(public)` layout, and the global 404 ("This page is not on the map.") and error ("Something went wrong.") pages.
5. Delete `src/data/*`, `src/components/nocturne/*`, `lib/states.ts`, the old studio and observation components, the Nocturne CSS aliases, and `leaflet` and `react-leaflet`.

Done when: no import of `@/data` or `nocturne` remains; no hex outside the generated tokens and the map palette; the build passes.

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `pnpm --dir web build`, `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, and the Playwright screenshot comparison of every route × preview state × role against its design page.

### WEB-27: One live workspace
Status: done (2026-10-09) · Phase 1 · Size L · Depends: WEB-05, WEB-22 · Blocks: none
Added 2026-10-09 (D30), as Janet started using DECA Mark. Her organization, `/o/deca-lab`, returned 404, while every page under `/o/deca` showed made-up data and a made-up person. This task makes every workspace page read and write the API for the signed-in person. It removes the sample workspace, the fixtures, the Preview data marker, the set-up flow and the session-only sample actions, and it puts the real name, email and initials in the header. The notes at the top of WEB-01 and WEB-05 to WEB-26 say which parts of them this task delivered or retired.
Read first: D30 in `docs/plan/decisions.md`; the Honesty section of `web/AGENTS.md`; `contracts/openapi.json`; `backend/WEB-FLOW-HANDOFF.md`.
Do:
1. Data layer.
   - `lib/api/client.ts` (server-only): reads the signed-in person's token once per request, and gives every request its own 15-second timeout.
   - `lib/api/workspace.ts` (server-only): cached reads with plain arguments. They are `getMe`, `getWorkspace` (never throws), `resolveOrg`, `resolveProject`, the organization, its projects, members and invitations, the project, its members and invitations, sites, packages, `getSitePlan`, forms, form versions, `listObservations` (the newest 500, with a `limited` flag) and `getObservation`.
   - `lib/api/mutations.ts` (server-only): one function per write endpoint. `lib/api/browser.ts` (browser): package upload and archive download straight to the API.
   - Pure modules with unit tests: `lib/workspace/*` (roles, the `/o` resolver, invitations, results), `lib/time.ts` (the project's timezone), `lib/labels.ts` (`OBS-3F2A1B`), `lib/observations/{answers,summary}.ts`, `lib/export/*` and `lib/sites/archive.ts` (reads a package archive with `fflate@0.8.2`).
2. Shell.
   - `/o` opens the person's last project, their only project or their first organization, or says "You are not in a project yet". Observers go to `/o/<org>/collect`.
   - `WorkspaceProvider` feeds the header, switchers, tabs, account menu, ⌘K and the shortcuts from `/v1/me`.
   - `LoadFailure` (sign in again, no access, or try again), `NotAvailable`, and `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` for the organization and the project. `features/people` holds the member and invitation tables and dialogs that Team and Members share.
3. Screens, as work packages WP1 to WP7.
   - WP1 sites and map packages, with an upload from QGIS layers.
   - WP2 forms: list, new form, versions, the draft editor and publish.
   - WP3 data and the record page.
   - WP4 overview, reports and QGIS.
   - WP5 project team and settings.
   - WP6 the organization's projects, members and settings.
   - WP7 invite, join, the home page, the collect page and the auth pages.
4. Cleanup.
   - Delete `src/fixtures`, `src/data`, `lib/preview.ts`, the Preview data marker and footer, the session stores, the web `ProposalNote` (mobile keeps its own) and the legacy components (`observations`, `basemaps`, `places`, `instrument`, `metrics`, `maps`, `qgis`, `studio`, `nocturne`), the Nocturne CSS aliases and the leaflet dependencies.
   - Add a lint rule that bans `@/fixtures`, `@/data` and `@/lib/preview`.
   - Write D30, the Honesty section of `web/AGENTS.md`, this file, the sitemap and the launch runbook.
5. Not available, as one short note each: saved named views (links replace them), the rounds plan, the zone editor (edit zones in QGIS), reviewing or excluding records, device readiness, live QGIS database access, deleting projects, organizations, sites or packages, and resending invitations.

Done when: no page under `/o` reads a fixture, and no code imports `@/fixtures`, `@/data` or `@/lib/preview`; a failed read shows `LoadFailure` and never an empty list; a viewer who opens Team or Settings sees the no-access note, and the page calls no manager-only endpoint for them; an upload from QGIS layers makes the new version current; every aggregate or export built from 500 observations says "Based on the newest 500 observations."

Verify: `pnpm --dir web check`, `format:check`, `build`, `test:unit`, `test:auth`, `test:api-errors` and `test:account`; from the root `pnpm tokens:check`, `pnpm forms:parity`, `pnpm plan:check`, `pnpm mobile:check` and `pnpm mobile:test`; a grep showing no `@/fixtures`, `/o/deca` or `onboarding` in `web/src`; and `sh scripts/e2e-local.sh` on the local stack (its header lists the options; the seed is `database/seed-web-workspace.mjs`, and nothing targets hosted services).

Verified 2026-10-09 (Node 22.22.0, pnpm 10.17.1): `test:unit` 229 of 229, `test:auth` 34 of 34, `test:api-errors` 31 of 31, `test:account` 12 of 12, `pnpm forms:parity` and `pnpm tokens:check`. The full local-stack Playwright run is not recorded here.

### WEB-28: Build a real manager zone editor
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size L · Depends: BE-18 · Blocks: QA-07
Owner: Claude web owner.
Read first: [Master plan](../docs/plan/zone-boundaries/README.md) and [component specification](ZONE-BOUNDARIES.md).
Do: First plan detailed UI and drawing suitability, then wire server-backed drafts/validation/publication with conflicts and accessibility.
Done when: Real API browser flow and two-manager conflict pass; no fake saves or complex-geometry loss.
Verify: Web checks/unit tests and local browser role/network/keyboard/touch cases; split if over five days.

### WEB-29: Display and filter historical zone versions
Status: todo · Phase 3 · Size L · Depends: BE-20 · Blocks: QA-07
Owner: Claude web owner.
Read first: [Master plan](../docs/plan/zone-boundaries/README.md) and [component specification](ZONE-BOUNDARIES.md).
Do: Plan and wire historical labels/version, scoped filters, v2 pagination/summary/export and inventory/legacy states.
Done when: Map/table/export agree beyond 500 without reclassification against current boundaries.
Verify: Web checks/unit tests and real browser history/filter/export scenarios.
