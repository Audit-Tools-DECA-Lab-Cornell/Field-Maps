				You can remove {policy.appName} data from your device yourself. To delete your account and the
				observations uploaded under it, send a request to the team that runs the app.
			</p>

			<h2 id="on-device">Remove data from your device</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Open <strong>Account and synchronisation</strong> and choose{" "}
					<strong>Sign out on this device</strong>. This removes your sign-in from the device. If you have
					been offline for a while, you may need a connection before the button appears. Signing out does not
					delete your records: everything you recorded, uploaded or not, stays on the device.
				</li>
				<li>
					Uninstall the app.
					<ul>
						<li>
							On Android, this deletes everything the app stored on the device. Records that were not
							uploaded cannot be recovered afterwards. Clearing the app’s storage in Settings has the same
							effect.
						</li>
						<li>
							On iPhone and iPad, deleting the app (not “Offload App”) removes your records from the
							device, but copies stay in any iCloud or computer backup made earlier. Your sign-in can
							remain in the iOS Keychain after the app is deleted, which is why you should sign out first.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 id="request">Request deletion of your account and uploaded data</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Email <Contact email={policy.contactEmail} /> from the email address you use to sign in, with the
					subject <strong>Delete my {policy.appName} account</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>Say whether you want your account deleted, your uploaded observations deleted, or both.</li>
				<li>
					We confirm the request with you before deleting anything, and complete it within{" "}
					{policy.deletionDays === null ? <Missing>number of days</Missing> : `${policy.deletionDays} days`}.
					We email you when it is done.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 id="what-is-deleted">What is deleted</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Your account:</strong> your sign-in email address, your password, your sign-in sessions and
					your membership of research projects.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Observations you uploaded:</strong> the map positions, times, initials and answers recorded
					under your account.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="what-may-be-kept">What may be kept</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Observations are research data that belong to a study. If a study’s approved protocol or the law
					requires records to be kept, we may keep your observations instead of deleting them, and we will
					tell you when we reply. We will remove the link to your account where we can, but your initials and
					the time and place of each observation stay with the record, so people on your team may still be
					able to tell who recorded it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our sign-in provider keeps a log of sign-ins and account changes, including your email address and
					IP address. It is kept {policy.logRetention ?? <Missing>log retention period</Missing>}.
				</li>
				<li>
					Deleted data can remain in our provider’s backups for a limited time, until they are overwritten.
				</li>
				<li>Copies already included in published or shared research results cannot be recalled.</li>
