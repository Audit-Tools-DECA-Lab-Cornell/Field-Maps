"""The instrument lifecycle: forms, drafts a manager edits, publishing and retiring (BE-11).

A definition is checked by the same canonical parser that validates uploads, so a version that
publishes is one every device and the server read identically. The stored definition names its own
version code and state, which is what the collector keys records and uploadability by.
