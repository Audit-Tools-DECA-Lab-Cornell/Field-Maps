# DECA Mark observation API

The [live web workspace handoff](WEB-FLOW-HANDOFF.md) documents current endpoint roles,
observation-detail metadata, bounded reporting, local browser fixtures and release checks.

FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS implement the first authenticated, append-only upload slice. The mobile app saves to SQLite first; its foreground queue uploads when connected. QGIS can consume the same committed database records through a scoped GIS view. QGIS itself is not the synchronization server.

## Run locally

Start Docker Desktop, then run from the product root:

```sh
pnpm db:start
pnpm backend:test
```

From `backend/`, start the API with `uv run --frozen uvicorn fieldmaps_api.main:create_app_from_config --factory --app-dir src --port 8000`. Stop any existing API on that port first. `config.local.json` points to local Supabase port 54322 and its generated ignored password file. `pnpm db:stop` preserves local database volumes; `pnpm db:reset` explicitly recreates the local schema and fictional fixtures.

Tests use ephemeral signing keys and fictional accounts on local Supabase, with real RLS through `fieldmaps_api`. `config.local.json` retains the hosted identity provider for existing development installs. To use local Auth as well as local Postgres, start from `backend/` with `DECAMARK_CONFIG=config.auth-local.json uv run --frozen uvicorn fieldmaps_api.main:create_app_from_config --factory --app-dir src --port 8001`. Set the web server's `DECAMARK_API_URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. HTTP identity URLs are allowed only on literal loopback hosts. There is no test-user bypass in the running API. `/health` is liveness. `/ready` checks the database and the cached signing-key set; it returns 503 when either is unavailable. Startup refuses database roles that are superusers or can bypass row security.

`make -C database api-build api-test` builds separate runtime and test images and runs the API suite against the existing local database. The test image includes pytest and Docker tooling for SQL fixtures; the runtime image contains neither and runs as UID 10001. Runtime-mounted password files must be readable by that user. The runtime health check uses the configured `PORT` and calls `/health`.

For the separate API connected to hosted PostGIS, use [Supabase setup](../docs/Supabase-Setup.md).

## Configure a development identity provider

Create/select a Supabase development project, use its asymmetric JWT signing key (ES256 or RS256), and create a test email/password account through its Auth dashboard. Configure the project's public values in `backend/config.local.json`:

```json
{
	"database_url": "postgresql+asyncpg://fieldmaps_api@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres",
	"database_password_file": "../database/.local/fieldmaps-api-password",
	"issuer": "https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1",
	"jwks_url": "https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json",
	"audience": "authenticated",
	"browser_origins": ["http://localhost:3000", "https://decamark.vercel.app"],
	"browser_origin_pattern": "https://deca-?mark-[a-z0-9-]+-audit-tools-web-apps-deca-lab-at-cornell\\.vercel\\.app"
}
```

`browser_origins` names the origins the management application is served from. Both configurations list localhost as well as the deployed site, because `pnpm api:hosted:up` runs this API on the development machine against the hosted database — a browser on `localhost:3000` is a normal caller of either one. `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are different origins to a browser, so both are listed. A browser
preflights any cross-origin call carrying an `Authorization` header, and the default is an empty
list — no origin allowed — so base map upload from the web application fails until its origin is
named here. It is an allowlist by design: a wildcard would let any page a signed-in manager has
open spend their token.

`browser_origin_pattern` covers the origins that cannot be listed one by one — Vercel names a
preview deployment `<project>-git-<branch>-<team>.vercel.app`, a new host per branch. The pattern
must match the whole origin (Starlette applies `fullmatch`), and the team slug is what makes it
safe: a host ending in someone else's team, or in a suffix like `.vercel.app.evil.invalid`, does
not match. Escape the dots. A pattern the regex engine cannot compile is refused at startup, not
per request.

These issuer/JWKS values are public. JWT verification needs no Supabase secret key. Account deletion separately requires the optional Auth Admin key described below. It validates the JWT signature, expiry, audience, and issuer and derives the user UUID from the signed subject. Legacy HS256 projects must switch to a supported asymmetric signing key before using this verifier. See [Supabase JWT documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/jwts).

Tenancy functions create organizations, projects and memberships. `GET /v1/me` now creates an active caller's profile and Training membership; organization and project management endpoints are available through the API. For manual local provisioning, create the matching Auth and profile rows before inserting a membership. Signing in alone grants no study-project access. From an authorized local administrator SQL session, replace `AUTH_USER_UUID` in this statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO fieldmaps.project_memberships (user_id, organization_id, project_id, role)
SELECT 'AUTH_USER_UUID'::uuid, organization_id, id, 'observer'
FROM fieldmaps.projects
WHERE id = '10000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, project_id) DO NOTHING;
```

Rebuild/restart the API after public config changes. Configure the same provider and project in [mobile connection settings](../mobile/README.md#enable-the-connected-development-slice), then rebuild the native development client for SecureStore and NetInfo. The Supabase account's database is not used by this local slice: Supabase supplies identity; observations remain in local PostGIS.

## Deploy it

The image carries every configuration it might run under and picks one at startup from the
`DECAMARK_CONFIG` environment variable. Unset, it reads `config.local.json`, which is the local
development file and names localhost Supabase — so a deployed container that does not set this
variable cannot start unless its configured local database is reachable with a restricted role.

On [Render](https://render.com/docs/docker), deploying `backend/Dockerfile`:

| What | Where | Value |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Environment variable | `DECAMARK_CONFIG` | `config.render.json` |
| Secret File | `database-password` | the `fieldmaps_api` role's password, nothing else in the file |

That is the whole list. Everything else — the pooler URL, the TLS settings, the CA path, the
identity provider, the browser origins — is public and lives in `config.render.json`, which
differs from `config.hosted.json` only in where the password is read from: Render mounts Secret
Files at `/etc/secrets/<name>`, and `make api-hosted-up` mounts a volume at
`/run/fieldmaps-secrets`.

`PORT` is set by the host and the container honours it, falling back to 8000. Choose a region
close to the database; this configuration points at `aws-0-us-east-1`.

Two things a deployment still needs that are not in this repository: the web application's
origin must appear in `browser_origins` before a browser there can call the API, and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_DECAMARK_API_URL` in the web deployment must name the API. Missing either one and
base map upload fails in the browser rather than at the API.

## Organizations, projects and invitations

`POST /v1/orgs` accepts `{"name":"Field Study","slug":"field-study","project":{"name":"First survey","code":"first-survey","timezone":"America/New_York"}}`. It atomically creates the organization, its owner membership and first project. An account may own at most three organizations. Read them with `GET /v1/orgs`, and their accessible projects with `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/projects`.

Owners/admins can edit organization details and create projects. Managers can edit project details and manage project members. Membership changes and ownership transfers use database functions that enforce the caller's role and prevent removing the last required owner/manager. People join through invitations rather than direct membership insertion.

Organization and project invitation endpoints create, list and revoke invitations. Creation returns the token and short code once; stored hashes and credentials never appear in lists. `POST /v1/invitations/preview` and `/redeem` accept either `{"token":"…"}` or `{"code":"…"}`. Preview reveals the destination and role without consuming a use or exposing a bound email. Redemption checks email binding, expiry and remaining uses atomically. Invitations default to one use and seven days. Revocation and member mutations return 204.

## Account deletion

`DELETE /v1/me` requires a runtime-mounted Supabase secret key (`sb_secret_…`). Set the optional `auth_admin_key_file` configuration field to that file's path, for example `/etc/secrets/supabase-secret-key` on Render. It is used only for the Auth Admin deletion call and never committed. Only `sb_secret_` keys with a nonempty, header-safe ASCII suffix are accepted; publishable keys and legacy JWT keys are rejected. Missing, unreadable or malformed configuration returns `503 storage_unavailable` before account data changes.

The API commits `forget_user()` first, removing memberships and clearing personal profile fields. A sole owner with other organization members, or the last project manager, receives `409 sole_owner` with no account change. It then calls the configured issuer's `/admin/users/{user_id}` endpoint with the key in `apikey`. Each request has a five-second I/O timeout and ten-second overall deadline, with one retry. Redirects are refused. Success or an already-absent Auth user (404) returns an empty 204.

If both attempts fail, the API returns `202 {"status":"pending"}`. The profile's `deleted_at` persists, prevents rejoining or restoring the account, and remains until Auth deletion cascades the profile away. Clients can repeat DELETE before signing out; GET/PATCH remain forbidden. ERROR logs and Sentry contain only the pending event and user UUID, without the key, upstream response body or exception detail. Pending profiles require operator follow-up if clients stop retrying; automated reconciliation is not implemented. Staging and production still require the runtime Secret File and deployed acceptance verification.

Local Supabase Auth may use HTTP only on literal `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. Other identity-provider hosts require HTTPS.

## Contract and guarantees

Requests have an `X-Request-Id`, echoed in responses. Access logs contain that identifier, response status and elapsed time, never request bodies, tokens or answers. `SENTRY_DSN` optionally enables sanitized API error events; no DSN is needed locally. Database errors are mapped by SQLSTATE: permission and validation failures retain their proper status, transient failures return 503, and unexpected errors return a sanitized 500.

Bodies are limited before JSON parsing: package submissions have 24 MiB, sync uploads 4 MiB, and other requests 256 KiB. Oversized streams return 413 even if the Content-Length header is absent or incorrect. Per-user token buckets allow five organization creations/hour, 60 invitation creations/hour, ten combined invitation previews/redemptions per ten minutes, and three account-deletion requests/hour. Exhaustion returns `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After`. These limits are in memory per API process, suitable for the single-instance pilot; multiple workers or replicas require shared limit storage. Restarting the process resets its buckets. The deletion policy applies to `DELETE /v1/me`.

The app factory in `main.py` includes identity, tenancy, collection and site routers. Routers keep authenticated transactions open around services; they complete the transaction before returning a response. `deps.py` sets the caller's database identity for each transaction. Services own validation, preparation and conflict decisions; repositories perform typed SQL access through matching `queries/` modules. Pure form and map-package logic lives under `domain/`.

`make -C backend openapi` exports sorted `contracts/openapi.json` using dummy configuration, without reading secrets or opening database/network connections. `pnpm contracts:generate` also regenerates each app's TypeScript declarations. CI checks these artifacts for drift. JWT verification permits 30 seconds of clock skew and rejects anonymous tokens.

`GET /v1/me` returns `profile`, `organization_memberships` and `project_memberships`. Organization owners/admins see their inherited projects with the manager role. `PATCH /v1/me` returns the profile; omitted fields are unchanged and explicit null clears nullable fields. Display names are trimmed to 1–100 characters, observer initials use 1–10 uppercase letters/digits, and locales are trimmed to 1–100 characters. Forgotten profiles and missing Auth users return `403 account_deleted`. All identity database scenarios passed against local Supabase on 2026-10-03.

API exceptions use one response envelope, also declared in OpenAPI:

```json
{"error":{"code":"validation_failed","message":"Request validation failed","details":{"fields":[{"id":"coordinates","problem":"Field required"}]}}}
```

Missing credentials use `unauthenticated`; rejected tokens use `token_invalid`. Both remain HTTP 401 with a Bearer challenge. Validation responses contain field identifiers and messages without the submitted input or validation context. Unexpected failures return a generic HTTP 500 response. Rejected CORS preflights retain the middleware's existing plain-text HTTP 400 response.

Success bodies, URLs, status codes and archive headers are unchanged by BE-03. Web and mobile now parse the error envelope through their typed API helpers, using local user copy and error codes for retry/sign-in/rejection. Unrecognized responses remain retryable on mobile to preserve collected records.

| Endpoint                                         | Behavior                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /v1/me`                                    | Bootstrap/read the caller's profile and memberships                |
| `PATCH /v1/me`                                  | Update only the caller's display name, observer initials or locale |
| `DELETE /v1/me`                                 | Forget the account, then delete its Auth identity; 202 if pending |
| `GET /v1/projects`                               | Projects visible to the verified account                          |
| `PUT /v1/projects/{project}/observations/{uuid}` | Validate and commit a new point or acknowledge an identical retry |
| `GET /v1/projects/{project}/observations/{uuid}` | Read a permitted observation                                      |
| `POST /v1/projects/{project}/packages`            | Check a base map submission and store a prepared package version  |
| `POST /v1/projects/{project}/packages/import`     | Convert uploaded QGIS vector sources for review without saving a package |
| `GET /v1/projects/{project}/packages`             | List prepared package versions and their state                    |
| `GET /v1/projects/{project}/packages/{package}`   | Read one package's manifest and every check it ran                |
| `GET /v1/projects/{project}/packages/{package}/archive` | Download the zip; the ETag is its `sha256`                  |

The PUT body contains `site_id`, `form_version`, `[longitude, latitude]` coordinates, `observer`, timezone-aware `observed_at`, and the answers as further top-level keys. The site and form version are resolved against the project's own rows rather than two string literals, and each answer is validated against that form version's stored definition, so a new instrument is a seeded form version and not a code change. Unknown sites and forms are still rejected, and an answer that fails its field's type or bounds returns 422.

Canonical definitions use the same defaults, conditions, dynamic options and reference checks as the mobile engine. Validation checks visible answers before pruning hidden ones; the normalization result carries the removed question IDs for the future sync endpoint. Existing stored `fields` definitions, including `shell-v1`, pass through the unchanged legacy validator. No published definition or hosted record is rewritten. Shared cases pass in Python and mobile, and local legacy upload/readback tests pass. Publishing Janet's draft remains separate work.

A package submission carries the site and form version, the GeoJSON layers (`ground` and `zones` required, `paths` and `trees` optional) and optionally the `.qgz`/`.qgs` project file, base64 encoded so no multipart dependency is needed. Preparation runs five checks — layers present, layer sources, coordinate reference, imagery licence, derived geometry — and stores the result either way: a blocked package keeps its reasons but does not download. Network tile sources block unless their host is allow-listed, because imagery permission is granted rather than assumed. The archive carries no clock, so its `sha256` is a content identity: the same submission prepared again next month is byte-identical, and the ETag is stable. When it was prepared lives on the row and in the API response, not inside the zip. Rows are immutable and preparing one needs the manager role.

A 200 receipt includes observation/project/user UUIDs, original `received_at`, and `accepted_revision: 1`. A receipt is returned only after commit. Identical retries return the original receipt; conflicting content returns 409 and preserves the original. The authenticated user and normalized payload fingerprint are immutable. A lost response can therefore be retried without duplicate records.

Project membership is enforced in both the API lookup and database row policies. The API uses a restricted non-owner role with transaction-local identity, preventing pooled connections from retaining another account's context. It can select permitted rows and insert observations; it cannot edit/delete observations or grant membership. The SQLite queue keeps records until matching receipt verification and never uploads unassigned practice records.

## QGIS conversion

`POST /v1/projects/{project}/packages/import` accepts `files`, an array of base64 `ProjectFile` objects. Managers can upload one `.qgz`/`.qgs` with its sources, optionally in a ZIP. The response returns the original `.qgs` as `project_file`, converted `layers` (`name`, `collection`), and per-layer `issues`. It neither creates a site nor saves a package. Clients review and assign the converted layers, optionally replace them with GeoJSON, then use the existing package submission with `site_code` and `form_version`.

Fiona's bundled GDAL reads only uploaded GeoPackage, shapefile and GeoJSON datasets through a fixed driver list. A layer's QGIS CRS assignment takes precedence over dataset metadata; coordinates are converted to EPSG:4326. Remote sources are not fetched. Missing/ambiguous sources, unsupported providers, raster layers and filtered layers return actionable issues. The original project remains available for preparation checks, including imagery policy. Uploaded ZIP paths, symlinks, encryption, duplicate paths and XML entities are rejected. The standard inert QGIS DOCTYPE is allowed without fetching its URL.

Conversion runs in a temporary subprocess with no inherited credentials, at most two simultaneous conversions per API process and a 45-second overall deadline. Limits are 16 MB of selected inputs, 64 MB of counted archive expansion, 256 archive members, two archive levels, 64 layers, 20,000 features per layer and 16 MB of result data. Linux also applies CPU, memory and file-size limits. These are resource and format restrictions, not an operating-system sandbox. Install the locked Fiona dependency in the API deployment; no QGIS Desktop installation is needed.

## Verification and limits

`pnpm backend:test` exercises real local Supabase, including token rejection, membership checks, connection-pool isolation, conflicting/concurrent retries, input boundaries, and restricted GIS readback. It also covers the error envelope, framework errors, sanitized failures and OpenAPI responses. Run `pnpm backend:check` for Ruff and BasedPyright. Current SQL verification is recorded in [the database README](../database/README.md). Native sign-in, mobile-to-running-API reconnect, and QGIS Desktop refresh still need a configured account/device acceptance run.

This is a local development service. Local Supabase is development infrastructure and must not be deployed as a production database. The hosted development database now has adapted migrations, restricted runtime credentials, and verified TLS. Production rollout still needs approved region/retention choices, a public HTTPS API deployment, managed secret injection, network restrictions, backups, monitoring, and API resource limits. The API has no attachments, update/delete synchronization, download cursor, or closed-app mobile background synchronization yet. Package archives live in a `bytea` column capped at 16 MB, which keeps them transactional with their manifest and checks and under the same row policies; moving to object storage later means replacing one column. The device cannot fetch a package yet.

Use QGIS read-only access for this slice; arbitrary GIS edits do not yet synchronize back to devices. The local database listens on port 54322; a QGIS Desktop login is not provisioned by these commands. The GIS test validates the database view, not the desktop application's behavior.
