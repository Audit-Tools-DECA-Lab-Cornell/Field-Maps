# Testing FieldMaps on a real QGIS map

How to get a base map into QGIS, draw your own site on it, load that site into the mobile collector, and check your collected points in QGIS on top of the base map.

Written September 21, 2026 against the code in this repository. Nothing below has been run end to end yet; the QGIS steps use standard QGIS features, and the app steps follow the current code.

## Read this first: three facts that shape the steps

1. **There is no "upload a map" feature.** The app has no import screen and no package download. Site maps ship inside the app as code (`mobile/src/maps/sample-site.ts`, used by `mobile/src/packages/bundled.ts`). "Uploading" your map means putting exported files in the repository and reloading the app.
2. **The app draws vector shapes only, not imagery.** Its base map is your site outline, buildings, paths, zones, and trees drawn as flat shapes. Satellite imagery lives in QGIS, not on the phone.
3. **Only the practice package uploads.** The API accepts `site_id = "sample-garden"` and form `shell-v1` only (`backend/src/fieldmaps_api/schemas.py`). To see your points in QGIS, put your site's geometry into the **Sample garden practice** package and keep its `siteId` unchanged. Points collected on Riverside (`janet-test-v1`) stay on the device.

## The whole flow

        QGIS: refresh "FieldMaps observations (live)" over the base map
```

Rough time: 15 minutes for Part 1, 30–60 minutes to draw a small site, 15 minutes to load it into the app.

---

## Part 1: Get a base map in QGIS (about 15 minutes)

QGIS 4.2.2 is installed at `/Applications/QGIS-final-4_2_2.app`.

### Option A: OpenStreetMap streets (built in)

1. Open QGIS and create a new project (**Project → New**).
2. In the **Browser** panel, expand **XYZ Tiles** and double-click **OpenStreetMap**.
3. Zoom to your site. Use the search box at the bottom left (the locator) or **View → Zoom to…** with coordinates.

### Option B: Satellite imagery (best for drawing a playground)

1. In the **Browser** panel, right-click **XYZ Tiles → New Connection…**
2. Name: `Esri World Imagery`
3. URL:

   ```text
   https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}
   ```

4. Max zoom level: `19`. Click **OK**, then double-click the new connection to add it.

Other sources:

- **New York State orthoimagery** (sharper for Ithaca-area sites): search the NYS GIS Clearinghouse at gis.ny.gov for its orthoimagery WMS service, then add it through **Layer → Add Layer → Add WMS/WMTS Layer**.
- **QuickMapServices plugin** (**Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins**, search "QuickMapServices"): one menu with many base maps.
- **Your own drone image or site plan**: if it is a GeoTIFF, drag it into QGIS. If it is a plain image or PDF, use **Layer → Georeferencer** to pin it to real coordinates first.

**Terms of use:** these tile services are for viewing and tracing in QGIS. Do not bulk-download them to ship inside the app. Check each provider's terms before using their imagery in a publication.

### Set the project coordinate system

1. Click the CRS button at the bottom right of the QGIS window.
2. Pick `EPSG:3857` (Web Mercator) for display. This matches the tile base maps.
3. Save the project somewhere outside `qgis/` for your own work, for example `~/Documents/FieldMaps/my-site.qgz`.

## Part 2: Draw your site (30–60 minutes for one playground)

Create one GeoPackage file holding one layer per kind of shape. The app understands these five:

| Layer       | Geometry | Required field              | Shown in the app as                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `ground`    | Polygon  | `kind` = `site` or `structure` | Site outline and buildings in the base map        |
| `paths`     | Line     | none                        | Paths overlay                                       |
| `trees`     | Point    | none                        | Trees overlay                                       |
| `zones`     | Polygon  | `id`, `label`               | Zone polygons overlay and the zone picker on the brief |

1. **Layer → Create Layer → New GeoPackage Layer…**
2. Database: `my-site.gpkg`. Table name: `ground`. Geometry type: **Polygon**. CRS: **EPSG:4326**.
3. Add a text field `kind`. Click **OK**.
4. Repeat for `paths` (LineString), `trees` (Point), and `zones` (Polygon, text fields `id` and `label`), saving into the same `my-site.gpkg`.
5. Select a layer, click the pencil (**Toggle Editing**), then **Add Polygon/Line/Point Feature**. Trace over the imagery. Right-click to finish each shape and fill in its fields.
6. Draw exactly **one** `ground` feature with `kind = site` (the whole site outline). Draw each building or play structure as `kind = structure`.
7. Draw zones as **rectangles** (turn on **View → Toolbars → Shape Digitizing** and use a rectangle tool). The app stores each zone as a west/south/east/north box, not a free polygon.
8. Save edits (pencil again → **Save**).

---

## Part 3: Export for the app (about 5 minutes)

For each of `ground`, `paths`, `trees`:

1. Right-click the layer → **Export → Save Features As…**
2. Format: **GeoJSON**.
3. File name: `mobile/src/maps/sites/my-site/ground.json` (use `.json`, not `.geojson`; the app's bundler only imports `.json`).
4. CRS: **EPSG:4326**. This is required. The app reads longitude/latitude.
5. Under **Layer Options**, set `RFC7946` to `YES` and `COORDINATE_PRECISION` to `7`.
6. Click **OK**.

For zones you only need numbers, not a file:

1. Open the `zones` attribute table and click **Open Field Calculator**. Add four virtual decimal fields: `x_min($geometry)`, `y_min($geometry)`, `x_max($geometry)`, `y_max($geometry)`.
2. Write down `west = x_min`, `south = y_min`, `east = x_max`, `north = y_max`, plus a centre point, for each zone.

Also note the whole site's extent: right-click `ground` → **Properties → Information → Extent**. Add a small margin (about 0.001°) on each side. This becomes the map's pan limit.

**Privacy:** if your site or its layout is not public, do not commit these files. Keep them uncommitted or ask before adding them to Git.

---

## Part 4: Load your site into the app (about 15 minutes)

All edits are in `mobile/src/maps/sample-site.ts`. The practice and Riverside packages both read this file, so both will show your site.

1. Import your exported files at the top:

   ```ts
   import groundData from "./sites/my-site/ground.json";
   import pathsData from "./sites/my-site/paths.json";
   import treesData from "./sites/my-site/trees.json";
   ```

2. Set the camera centre and pan limits from Part 3 (`[longitude, latitude]` and `[west, south, east, north]`):

   ```ts
   export const sampleCenter: Coordinate = [-76.4850, 42.4480];
   export const sampleBounds: LngLatBounds = [-76.4870, 42.4466, -76.4830, 42.4494];
   ```

3. Replace the hand-drawn `ground`, `sitePaths`, and `siteTrees` objects with your data:

   ```ts
   const ground = groundData as FeatureCollection;
   export const sitePaths = pathsData as FeatureCollection;
   export const siteTrees = treesData as FeatureCollection;
   ```

4. Replace the three entries in `siteZones` with your zones: `id`, `label`, `centre`, `west`, `south`, `east`, `north`. The practice package uses only the **first** zone, so make the first one cover the area you will test in.
5. **Do not change** `siteId: "sample-garden"` in `mobile/src/packages/bundled.ts`. Changing it makes the API reject every upload.
6. Run the checks:

   ```bash
   pnpm mobile:check
   ```

7. Reload the app. This is a JavaScript-only change, so reloading Metro is enough when a development build is already installed:

   ```bash
   pnpm mobile:simulator
   ```

   Press `r` in the Metro terminal to reload. If no development build is installed yet, follow the build steps in [the mobile README](../mobile/README.md#run).

The map allows zoom 15.5 to 21 and cannot pan outside `sampleBounds`. If the map opens blank or locked, `sampleBounds` does not contain `sampleCenter` or your first zone's centre.

## Part 5: Collect points and see them in QGIS

### Collect

1. Start the API against hosted Supabase: `pnpm api:hosted:up` (see [Supabase setup](Supabase-Setup.md)).
2. In the app, sign in, open **Sample garden practice**, arm **Place a point**, tap your site, and fill in the three practice fields.
3. Save. With the app open and online, the record moves to **synced** on its own. The Records screen shows its status.

### View on top of the base map

1. Open your QGIS project from Part 1 (the one with the base map).
2. Add the live observation layer: **Layer → Add Layer → Add PostgreSQL Layers…**, connect with service `fieldmaps_training`, turn off **Only look in public**, open schema `gis`, add `sample_observations`, and choose `fid` as the key. Full connection details and the password rules are in [the QGIS README](../qgis/README.md).
3. Drag the observation layer above the base map in the **Layers** panel.
4. After each new upload, right-click the layer → **Refresh** (or press **F5**). QGIS does not refresh on its own.

QGIS reprojects the EPSG:4326 points onto the EPSG:3857 base map automatically.

### Known snags in the current `qgis/` folder

- **The new database starts empty.** `pg_service.conf` points at the Field Maps GIS project, provisioned September 22, 2026. The layer shows points only after the app uploads to it; the QGIS password is read from the `fieldmaps_qgis_secrets` volume as described in [the QGIS README](../qgis/README.md).
- **The saved project file is missing.** `open-training.command` opens `qgis/fieldmaps-training.qgs`, which is not in the folder; only an older backup, `fieldops-training.qgs~`, is there. Use the manual layer steps above, then save your own project. The launcher still works for setting `PGSERVICEFILE` if you point it at your project.

## Not supported yet

- Satellite imagery or raster tiles on the phone. Offline imagery needs a packaged tile format (MBTiles or PMTiles), licensing that allows offline use, and code in `mobile/src/maps/` to load it.
- Importing a QGIS project or GeoPackage directly into the app, or downloading site packages. Delivery is stubbed behind `PackageProvider` in `mobile/src/packages/site-package.ts`.
- Uploads for any site other than `sample-garden` or any form other than `shell-v1`. See [the Janet test form scope](Janet-Test-Form-Scope.md).
- Editing observations in QGIS and sending changes back to devices.
