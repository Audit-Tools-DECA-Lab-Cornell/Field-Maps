# Sitemap: every page, what it does, and what works today

Part of the [design track](README.md), stages 0 and 1. Draft of 2026-10-01, written from the code, the READMEs and the plan files. The stage 0 screenshots are still to come.

**Status legend**

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | **Real.** Works against the real API or database |
| 🟡 | **Built, not real.** The screen exists, but it reads fixtures or bundled data, or it saves nothing |
| 🔴 | **Planned.** In the production plan under the task ID shown, not built yet |
| 🆕 | **New.** You asked for it, but the plan does not have it yet. It needs the decision named (U-number) |

## 1. What exists today

### Web: 10 routes, 1 partly connected to the API

| Route | What it shows | State |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page | 🟡 Static |
| `/overview` | Counts, coverage by zone and round, what is blocking | 🟡 Fixtures |
| `/observations` | Map, table and record detail over one filter set kept in the URL; export | 🟡 Fixtures. The export is generated in the browser from the fixtures |
| `/places` | Sites with zones, rounds, observers and a zone plan | 🟡 Fixtures. No site creation, no zone editor |
| `/instrument` | **Form Studio**: Janet's form with a phone preview and local draft edits; the variable library | 🟡 Reads the real form file in `contracts/forms/`. Drafts stay in the browser, and there is no publish |
| `/basemaps` | Upload QGIS layers as a site package and see the server's checks | ✅ / 🟡 The only screen that calls the API. It needs a pasted manager token and a project ID from an environment variable. Not yet tried against staging (WEB-01) |
| `/qgis` | Connection settings for QGIS | 🟡 Fixture values |
| `/onboarding` | A five-step set-up walkthrough | 🟡 Clickable preview; saves nothing (WEB-18) |
| `/privacy`, `/privacy/delete-data` | Policy pages for the store listings | ✅ Static. The text is out of date: it says administrators create accounts (WEB-14) |

**Not built at all:**
- sign-in, sign-up or any other auth;
- 404 and error pages;
- the organization and project in the URL;
- team, settings and account pages.

### Mobile: 7 screens in one flat stack

| Screen | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| Assignments (`index`) | Lists studies (site packages); resumes an unfinished draft | 🟡 Four bundled studies, two of them fake |
| Brief | Choose the zone and the round | 🟡 Bundled sites |
| Field | Map; place a point; one question per screen | 🟡 The form engine and saving to the phone are real. The maps are bundled; Fall Creek's is real QGIS data |
| Review | Check the answers; blocks the save while required answers are missing | 🟡 Real logic |
| Saved | What carries into the next observation | 🟡 Real logic |
| Records | Queue states: held, on device, synced, needs attention | ✅ For the practice form (`shell-v1`). Records on Janet's form stay held on the device |
| Account | Sign in | ✅ Sign-in only |

**The current mobile redesign has never run on a device or a simulator.** It is verified by types, tests and bundling only (`mobile/README.md`).

**Not built at all:**
- sign-up, code verification and password reset;
- joining a project, and the profile screen;
- the project list from the server;
- package download;
- record detail;
- the sign-out warning and account deletion.

## 2. What the pages are about

```
Account
└─ Organization ── members (owner · admin · member), invitations
   └─ Project ──── members (manager · observer · viewer), invitations and join codes, QGIS access grants
      ├─ Site ──── map packages (immutable versions, uploaded from QGIS)
      │  └─ Zone   (polygons from the current package; DB-12)
      ├─ Form ──── versions (draft → published → retired; DB-09)
      └─ Observation: a point, plus site, zone, round, form version, observer code and answers
```

Every project page acts on something in this tree. A page that does not belongs at the account level.

**Who sees what on the web** (proposed):

| Page | Org owner / admin | Manager | Viewer | Observer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Org projects | all | own projects | own projects | → "Get the app" (U3) |
| Org members, form library, org settings | ✓ | — | — | — |
| Overview, data, reports | ✓ | ✓ | read only | — |
| Sites, zones, packages | ✓ | edit | read only | — |
| Forms | ✓ | edit, publish | read only | — |
| Team | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |
| QGIS | ✓ | ✓ | exports only | — |
| Project settings | ✓ | ✓ | — | — |

An org admin acts as a manager on every project in the org (`docs/plan/product.md`).

## 3. Target web sitemap

The URL scheme follows `web/PLAN.md` ("Target route tree"). New items carry their U-number.

**Navigation.**
- Inside a project, the rail is Overview · Data · Sites · Forms · Team · QGIS · Reports · Settings.
- The header holds the org and project switcher and the account menu.
- Viewers do not see Team or Settings.

**Settings at three levels.** Your "Settings page" becomes three pages, each beside what it configures:
- `/account` for you;
- org settings;
- project settings.

The account menu links to all three.

**Where the QGIS upload goes.** A package belongs to one site, so the upload lives on the site page (WEB-08). The QGIS page lists every site's package state, links to each upload, and covers the outbound direction too. Everything QGIS-related is then reachable from one place, while the upload itself stays on the site.

## 4. Target mobile sitemap

The route groups follow `mobile/PLAN.md` ("Target structure").

Across every screen: an offline indicator, "Sign in to resume uploads" (MOB-08), the resume-draft prompt, and the loading, empty, error and offline states (MOB-17).
```

Managers use the web, on a laptop or an iPad. Org and project creation happens on the web only (D1), so the mobile app has no set-up screens.

## Decisions

Recommendations are mine. Some of these need Janet.

### U1: One set of words

The same thing has different names on web, mobile and in the database:

| Concept | Web today | Mobile today | Database | Proposed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A study | Project | Study, Assignment | `projects` | **Project** |
| A place | Places | Site, Package | `sites` | **Site** (WEB-06 already renames `/places` to `sites`) |
| An area inside it | Zone | Zone | `zones` (DB-12) | **Zone** |
| The questionnaire | Instrument | Form | `form_versions` | **Form**, with **versions** |
| The offline map bundle | Base map | Package | `site_packages` | **Map package** |
| A collected record | Observation | Record | `observations` | **Observation** everywhere, including the mobile tab |

### U2: Zone boundaries: who is the authority?

**Today**
- Zones come from the `zones` layer of the QGIS upload, and the server reduces them to bounding boxes. DB-12 will keep the real polygons, one set per package version.
- `web/README.md` rules out a zone editor on purpose: "a second authority beside QGIS would drift from it."

**Options**
- **A. QGIS stays the only authority.** The web shows zones and lets you name them, describe them and set targets.
- **B. Edit on the web.** Each save creates a new package version, the same as an upload, so nothing is overwritten. The zones download back to QGIS as GeoJSON.
- **C. The web becomes the authority**, and QGIS reads zones from the database.

**Recommendation:** design B now, so the site page has room for it, and build A for the pilot. Build B after the pilot, unless Janet needs to redraw zones in the field before then.

### U3: Join codes and observers on the web

**Today:** observers redeem codes on the phone; the web handles invitation links only. The API's preview and redeem calls already accept a code.

**Recommendation**
- Add `/join` to the web. It reuses the `/invite` confirm screen, so it costs little.
- An observer who signs in on the web gets one page: "You collect in the app", with store links and a QR code, plus a read-only list of their own observations.

### U4: Global forms

**Today:** forms belong to one project (DB-09), and a published version never changes.

**Options**
- **A. Org templates.** "Use in project" copies a template into the project as a new draft. Each project's forms then stay independent.
- **B. Shared forms**, one form used live by many projects. This breaks:
  - the per-project GIS views (GIS-01);
  - project-scoped access rules;
  - "retire" as a safe action, since retiring a shared form would stop collection in every project at once.

**Recommendation:** A, plus an org-wide variable library (reusable questions), which the instrument page already sketches. Both need a new table. They come after the pilot, unless the pilot runs more than one project.

### U5: QGIS publishing gate, and "monitoring QGIS"

**Today and in the plan**
- QGIS reads live typed views of **every accepted observation** in a project that has a reader grant (GIS-01).
- QGIS pulls data whenever a layer refreshes, so there is nothing being synced that could be monitored.
- The September study chose "no send-to-QGIS action" on purpose.

**Options**
- **A. Keep it automatic.** The QGIS page shows what QGIS can see: counts by form version, the latest record, and who has access.
- **B. A review gate.**
  - Each observation gets a review state: new, approved or excluded.
  - A project setting decides what QGIS sees: "every accepted observation" or "approved only".
  - The QGIS page becomes a publishing queue: approve by site, round or date; exclude flagged records; keep a log of what was published.
- **C. Releases.** A manager publishes a frozen dataset version that QGIS reads, while live data stays private.

**Recommendation:** B, defaulting to "every accepted observation" so the pilot never waits on approvals.
- **Cost:** review columns on `observations`, a filter in the GIS-01 views, approve and exclude actions on the Data page, and the DB-13 audit log.
- **About monitoring:**
  - The QGIS page can honestly show: published and pending counts, grants and when they expire, and the last time something was published.
  - "When QGIS last read the data" would need connection logging on the database, which Supabase may not expose. That needs a short spike before the page promises it.

### U6: Rounds and assignments

**Today**
- A round is a number the observer picks in the brief.
- The mobile home says "Assigned to you", but its list is fixtures.
- The overview shows "rounds under target", also from fixtures.
- No table holds rounds, schedules, targets or assignments.

**Question for Janet:** are rounds planned ahead (dates, times of day, which observer covers which site)?
- **If yes:** add a Rounds page on the web and "Today" on the mobile home.
- **If no:** drop the "Assigned" wording, and the mobile home is simply projects and sites.

**Recommendation:** no scheduling for the pilot. Add coverage targets (rounds per zone) as a project setting, so the overview's coverage numbers are real.

### U7: What a report is

**Today:** the overview on screen, and CSV and GeoJSON exports (WEB-12). Nothing called a report.

**Options**
- **A. Printable summaries.** One page per site, round or date range: a map of points by play type, counts, coverage and data-quality flags, saved as a PDF from the browser.
- **B. Saved views.** Name a filter set on the Data page and share it.
- **C. A scheduled email digest.**
- **D. A custom report builder.**

**Recommendation:** A and B first. Ask Janet what she would hand to a funder or a partner school; that defines A.

### U8: Field guide on mobile

Questions already carry a `hint` in the form definition (`contracts/forms/`). A Field guide screen could list every question and option with its meaning, available offline, so an observer can check what counts as "Imaginative" play in the middle of a round.

**Recommendation:** yes. It is small, and it reads the form version the observer is collecting with.

### U9: Light, dark, or both

This is Q8 in [decisions.md](../plan/decisions.md#open-questions). It is decided in stage 5 with outdoor tests, not here.

### U10: Where the design time comes from

See "The cost" in [README.md](README.md#order-each-slice-is-ready-before-its-build-phase).
