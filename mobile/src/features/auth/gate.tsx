/**
 * Which part of the collector opens: sign-in, onboarding or the app. The root layout guards its route
 * groups with this (Stack.Protected), so a screen never has to check by itself.
 *
 * The rule:
 * - A live session or an account cached on this device counts as signed in, so an observer whose token
 *   expired in the field keeps collecting offline. Only a deliberate sign-out clears the cache.
 * - An account the server reported deleted (403 account_deleted, remembered across restarts) is not
 *   signed in: welcome opens and names its records, which stay on this device and cannot upload. Nothing
 *   new is collected for it.
 * - A signed-in account goes through onboarding when neither its server profile (`/v1/me`) has observer
 *   initials nor this device has a profile for it. A profile started here but not finished (the join
 *   step is still ahead) keeps onboarding open whatever the server says; one finished here opens the app
 *   offline even before the server has it.
 * - Until `/v1/me` is known for an account with no profile here, the gate holds the splash, so
 *   onboarding never flashes for an observer the server already knows.
 *
 * Review builds can force a route with a dev override (the (dev)/states screen).
